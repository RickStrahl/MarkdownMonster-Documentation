Markdown Monster provides a @icon-star-color:goldenrod **Favorites** list in the Sidebar, which allows you to easily store and quickly recall saved file or folder references for quick access. 

The favorite list can be organized into groups and a search bar lets you quickly find Favorites if your list is long. Groups can be used for simple task categorization or for separating separate projects via folder nesting.

### Favorites in Markdown Monster
Markdown Monster includes a Favorites Sidebar on the left with the @icon-star-color:goldenrod Favorites Tab:

The easiest way to get Favorites into the list is by ** dragging an open document tab into the Favorites panel**. Just drop it under a folder or ontop of an existing item and the favorite gets added there. You can also **drag and drop from Windows Explorer** (or any other Shell file tool) into the Favorites list, or you can manually create a new Favorite via `ctrl-n` in the panel, or the @icon-plus icon in the panel toolbar.

You can access the favorites panel either from the @icon-star-color:goldenrod toolbar button or from the **Recent Files Menu dropdown** which is accessible from multiple places:

You can also **Add to Favorites** from the Tab Context menu and the Folder Browser file/folder Context Menu.
