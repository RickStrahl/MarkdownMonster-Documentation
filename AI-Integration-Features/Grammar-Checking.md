You can check grammar and style suggestions using the **Check Grammar of Selection**. This feature works by showing Grammar suggestions in a Diff Window that shows original and fixed text side by side along with an editable block of the fixed text below:

You can make changes to the text below which updates the *Checked* display on the right.

You can click the **Accept** button to apply the changes against the active selection of the original text in the editor.

> #### @icon-warning Keep Selections small
> This feature tends to be somewhat slow to process especially on larger blocks of text so we suggest you keep this to one or several paragraphs at a time. 
> 
> It's also easier to work with smaller checks rather than the entire document both in terms of performance as well as being able to see the and manage the changes.
